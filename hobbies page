    <p>These days, you’ll find him enjoying card games or spending time with his grandkids, cherishing every laugh and shared moment.
        He’s also working on a project car with his son, a hobby that’s both challenging and meaningful, offering them time together and a shared goal. While Marcus sometimes misses the camaraderie of work, he’s embracing the slower rhythm of life and all that comes with it. A proud veteran and family man, he holds tight to one core belief: treat others the way you want to be treated. For Marcus, values, character, and integrity are the true measures of a man.
